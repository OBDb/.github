# Welcome to the OBD database (OBDb)

The OBD database is an open source community effort to document the diagnostic parameters and codes (DTCs) that can be used to talk to cars.

## Getting involved

Browsing the database doesn't require any kind of account, but if you want to contribute then you'll need a GitHub account ([signing up is easy!](https://github.com/signup)).

The OBDb is organized around vehicle makes and models. If there isn't yet [a repository](https://github.com/orgs/ElectricSidecar/repositories) for your vehicle's make and model, please [request it](https://github.com/ElectricSidecar/meta/issues/new?assignees=jverkoey&labels=new-vehicle&projects=&template=new-make-and-model.md&title=%5Bmake%5D+model).
